## P02 - AutoComplete in Linear Time
### Madhav Adhikari
### Description:
loading a singly linked list with dictionary words, then timing how it takes to look them up. I have applied the following approachesÂ to this program.

- Read text file and load in linkedList by lowering each words
- Display required time to load
- Ask user to search words and capture of keyboard input, without hitting the enter key (using mygetch.hpp)            
- Search the required letter in LinkedList and provide 10 autosuggestion words with search time and number of matched words
- Append the letter with another typed letter and search in linkedList
- Continue the program till typed capital 'Z'
