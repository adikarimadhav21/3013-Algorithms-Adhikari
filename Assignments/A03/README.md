### Description:

Firstly, we need a way to print out our program banner cover pages by using VSCode Extension called Banner Comments + to put on assignments. 

Secondaly,To emphasize the importance of organizing a programming project above and beyond the "code" itself. If someone cannot decipher your code, they rely on comments. If someone cannot run your code, they rely on instructions. If someone wants to use something you wrote in their own project (non academically!) they will rely on good comments, a good description of the project, and good instructions on how to use your project. The file main.cpp will demostrate to ensure proper commenting in program
